data-structures-and-algorithms


## Challenge

* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
* If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
* If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
* If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
* Return the tree with its new values.
## Approach & Efficiency
* Traverse from the first node to last node in the list until given node is found.
* The BigO is O(n)
