data-structures-and-algorithms

## Challenge

* Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. 
* Return the maximum value stored in the tree (without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language). 
* You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
