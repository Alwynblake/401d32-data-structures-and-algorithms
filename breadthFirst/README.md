## Challenge

* Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. 
* Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; 
* print every visited nodeâ€™s value.
## Approach & Efficiency
* Traverse from the first node to last node in the list until given node is found.
* The BigO is O(n)
