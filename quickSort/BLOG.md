**** Problem: 
Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. 
Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through 
some sort of visual.

```
ALGORITHM QuickSort(arr, left, right)
    if left < right
        // Partition the array by setting the position of the pivot value 
        DEFINE position <-- Partition(arr, left, right)
        // Sort the left
        QuickSort(arr, left, position - 1)
        // Sort the right
        QuickSort(arr, position + 1, right)

ALGORITHM Partition(arr, left, right)
    // set a pivot value as a point of reference
    DEFINE pivot <-- arr[right]
    // create a variable to track the largest index of numbers lower than the defined pivot
    DEFINE low <-- left - 1
    for i <- left to right do
        if arr[i] <= pivot
            low++
            Swap(arr, i, low)

     // place the value of the pivot location in the middle.
     // all numbers smaller than the pivot are on the left, larger on the right. 
     Swap(arr, right, low + 1)
    // return the pivot index point
     return low + 1

ALGORITHM Swap(arr, i, low)
    DEFINE temp;
    temp <-- arr[i]
    arr[i] <-- arr[low]
    arr[low] <-- temp
```

input: [8,23,42,16,15]
output: [8,15,16,23,42]

Algorithm:
* Choose the highest index value has pivot
* Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot
* left points to the low index
* right points to the high
* while value at left is less than pivot move right
* while value at right is greater than pivot move left
* if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right
* if left â‰¥ right, the point where they met is new pivot
