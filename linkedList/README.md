## Challenge

Writes the following methods for the Linked List class:

.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
## Approach & Efficiency
* Work with singly linked lists and performs an ` insert`.
* Traverse from the first node to last node in the list until given node is found.
* The BigO is O(n)

## Solution
