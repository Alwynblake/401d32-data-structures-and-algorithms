# hash tables

## Challenge
Implements a Hashtable with the following methods:
1.	add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2.	get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3.	contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4.	hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
